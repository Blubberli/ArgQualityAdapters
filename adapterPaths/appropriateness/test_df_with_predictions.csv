300	Should teenage drivers be limited to carrying only a set number of other teens at once?   stance: yes, teens should be limited to carrying a small number of teen passangers at once.:	"Perhaps not all teens; there is a good case for new drivers. Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway) should have restrictions on the number of passengers.
Personally, I would also sugest a restriction on how far a newly licesnsed driver can travel on thier own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on thier first motorway jaunt."	0	[0.5079404711723328, 0.4920596182346344]
1479	Should physical education be mandatory in schools:	The minimum length for an argument is 50 characters.

1575	Tv is better than books:	Books are better than TV because books have each and every detail briefly . we get to read books like story books , fairy tales, ghost stories etc these books help us in bringing imaginary power in us . In TV only some points are explained and sometimes we cant remember it easily but in books if we forget anything we can now and then read it .At last I only want to tell that books are much and much better than TV .	1	[0.4975773096084595, 0.5024226307868958]
1335	I got lots of money who wants to share it?:	If your serious, maybe think about donating some to a worthy cause.  A young family struggling to make it and going to work everyday.  An elderly person living on social security and can't afford their electric bill.  Donate to a children's hospital, animal protective society, or senior center in your area.  Lots of things you can do with it.  I hope you find what your looking for.	0	[0.513500988483429, 0.48649895191192627]
734	What do you think about the introduction of id cards?:	"I heard that in Australia and US (I think, 2 countries that use ID cards anyway) there is a much higher rate of identity theft, because all someone would need to steal your identity is one card instead of having to go through loads of bills etc. to get all your details. I think it's the most stupid idea and you'll probably end up having to have an ID card to prove who you are in order to get an ID card, or you'll need a passport, driving licence or some other such thing that not everybody has.

Then again if they introduced them and someone stole the identity of someone like the prime minister and got all his money then they'd just see how silly an idea it was."	1	[0.5107590556144714, 0.48924094438552856]
1847	Cmv: in blind listening tests, most people would fail differentiate mp3 from the original cd source (even on good equipment).:	"Lately I have been wondering about this. Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag mp3's. But I'm willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he'd fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at say 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He's mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.

That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's (Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab etc.) or LP's. But my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system."	0	[0.5150900483131409, 0.4849099814891815]

320	Tv is better than books:	"I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves.
I am not completely against TV but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people

Software should never be able to be patented (just Copywrighted) this includes software algorithims

* Most software algorithms are not non-obvious (Shopping cart, sorting a deck of cards)
* Software Algorithms for more complicated stuff (Compression Algorithm, communication standards etc etc) are also obvious to people in the field. (JPEG compression concepts are well understood by anyone who knows anything about compression (DCT, Run-length encoding etc etc) the only thing that should be protectable is the final product. 

* It doesnt give a meaningful edge to any company other than to extort and complicate the creation of new products. 

* most meaningful software used is open sourced, what companies pay for is the specialized tailoring that is done to build a custom application; again your product is protectable by copyright not patent. "	0	[0.49370241165161133, 0.5062975883483887]
587	Cmv: watching/reading newspapers and television news has become almost completely unnecessary.:	"After listening to CGP Grey and Brady Haran on their podcast, I had to agree with Grey that news websites and television channels have become redundant for anyone seeking important information on current affairs.

Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months.

I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient.

I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?

Edit: I am not questioning the importance of journalism. It is my position in the news chain. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines."	0	[0.5107430815696716, 0.4892568588256836]
1389	Kurt cobain's death   stance: murder:	"I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered."	1	[0.5121287107467651, 0.4878712594509125]
1378	Cmv: facial plastic surgery can turn you into a chick magnet and pave you the way for male modeling.:	"I'm a really young male (19) but I am seriously considering having a rhinoplasty, chin , jaw and cheek augmentation. I would never say that I'm ugly but I am pretty average. I think that once I get the procedures done I will become dramatically more attractive/handsome more girls will check me and that would boost my confidence to approach them, or even make them approach me. I also believe that having a really attractive face(and a strong body which I'm gonna build) will help me get into male modeling, something that is really interesting and gives you the opportunity to meet new people and travel more.

2179	Are we heading towards a global recession?   stance: yes:	"(1)Share prices across the world have continued to fall, with market indicators this week reaching record lows in the US, Europe and Japan. Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres.
(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.
(3) Sky-rocketing oil prices (I think that’s all that needs to be said)"	1	[0.5118763446807861, 0.48812365531921387]

business name: gordon ramsay hell's kitchen. city: las vegas. categories: american (new), restaurants, breakfast & brunch, burgers:"	"Met all our expectations! 

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!"	0	[0.5123459696769714, 0.48765403032302856]

business name: harley davidson las vegas cafe. city: las vegas. categories: barbeque, american (traditional), restaurants, burgers:"	"Surprisingly good! Not sure why so many negative reviews for this place but that certainly wasn't our experience. 
We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated immediately. The place filled up over the next 15-20 minutes but our server remained efficient, competent and helpful. 
We ordered the 2-for-$35 bbq platter and it was awesome!  Ribs, chicken, pulled pork, tri tip, a hot link and an assortment of sides.  The tri tip, ribs and chicken were excellent and I never even got around to the pulled pork.  Honestly, better bbq than any place we have back home.
Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.
All in all, I was more than pleased by both the food and the atmosphere."	0	[0.5153552889823914, 0.48464468121528625]
497	Should physical education be mandatory in schools:	This will help kids learn good qualities like leadership and discipline. This could also lead to help childhood obesity.

To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point.

Non-violent drug offenders, who need rehab, not warehousing with real criminals, have often been given longer sentences than violent criminals.

422	I've just been released from a psychiatric unit and want to know what repercussions this might have on my job:	"emergency petitons for psychiatric evaluations are NOT an arrest.. nor are they availible for review by an employer.. the American Disablities Act prevents this.. and gives you ground for a law suit if it is used against you.. you do need to make your employer aware of your conditon.. 

if he fires you.. you will file a claim with the ADA.. chances are they will deny your claim if you didnt make them aware of your illness prior to employment.. after the ADA reviews this .. you will be given a ""right to sue"" letter.. (whether the ADA find validity in your claim or not-- you still have to go through this) 

only after the proceedings with the ADA can you get a lawyer involved.. he will argue that you didnt make your employer aware of your illness prior to employment because they would have not hired you in the first place.. 

many lawyers work probono and have a field day with employers like these.. 

bottom line.. mental illnesses such as Bipolar.. are a disabilty furthermore.. you may also be eligible for Social Security.. so you dont have to put up with narrowminded employers.."	0	[0.48870575428009033, 0.5112943053245544]

It's not the free exercise clause that deals with discrimination against gays. So, the ""freedom of religion"" right is not the issue.

The issue is the Establishment Clause: ""Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion..."" As interpreted, that basically means that religious reaons cannot be used to justify secular laws. 

Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority. Just as long as nobody else bases any legal actions on a different religion.

It's pure hypocrisy and pure religious-based discrimination. And while people are certainly entitled to either on a personal level, they cannot do so as a matter of law."	0	[0.5031439661979675, 0.49685603380203247]

2130	Why is the issue of women’s rights considered separately from general issues of human rights?:	"I don't know if this fits in with the emphasis in your class, but this is my personal view...

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

From a legal standpoint, there are two factors to forming a contract:  offer and acceptance.  Your granddaughter offered you a loan of a thousand dollars, and you accepted it.  There was consideration (something of value was exchanged) - you got the money to fix the water heater, and she got a promise of repayment.

I take from your question that you don't want to pursue legal action against your granddaughter, for which you are to be commended.  In order to salvage your relationship with her, I think you should repay her, tell her that this is the only wedding gift you can afford is repaying the debt, and LET IT GO."	0	[0.5136865973472595, 0.48631343245506287]

In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public.

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.

Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So it depends person to person.

For three primary reasons: 

1. It seems only logical that a public institution that mandates the pupils be there for an upwards of 7 hours feed them.

2. If you want to curb obesity, 

3. Not all students can afford to bring a quality meal to school, have the money to buy one, or have the time to make one in the morning.

There are already laws and fines in place regarding improperly documenting your workers.  The problem is our elected officials would rather waste our money & time by presenting completely new regulations (justifying their jobs) instead of making the appropriate government administration enforce the laws we already have.

Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

759	Is the usa still globally considered a true superpower anymore?   stance: the usa is bigger, better and stronger than ever!:	However, creature comforts and political freedom are still such attractive features to non-Americans that we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day. There is no doubt that we have our own societal ills, but the US is still at the top of innovation, whereas China, India and even much of Europe can only replicate our inventions, follow in our research, and imitate our military strength.	1	[0.5190497636795044, 0.4809502363204956]

I would explain ""How would you feel if somebody killed a family member or a close friend? Would you want them to be punished?""

1159	Human growth and development should parents use spanking as an option to discipline:	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take. That's why we have a mouth to speak and say what's right from wrong and wrong from right.	0	[0.5187662243843079, 0.48123377561569214]
1953	Which type of endeavor is better a personal pursuit or advancing the common good:	Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.	1	[0.5197579264640808, 0.4802420735359192]

480	India has the potential to lead the world:	"First of, India does NOT have the potential to ""rule"" the world because have you seen the people? Good Indian people with good minds are in some foreign country getting a Nobel prize while the others are just stuck ups who don't do anything and push the people who come up, down. Nobody actually lets anyone succeed. That's why!"	1	[0.5119205713272095, 0.4880794882774353]
1661	If you own a bussiness and a house and you are not legal in usa can goverment take it away from you?:	"The person above is absolutely wrong.  Property is property.  He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage.  His business will remain his business as long as he can run it. He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business, the government can't take it away just because he is here illegally.

But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he doesn't pay taxes, but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever.  It is not true that a person here illegally cannot pay property and business taxes.  The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes.  

So tell him not to worry about the government, just make enough money to pay the bills."	0	[0.5134910941123962, 0.48650896549224854]
