382	Pro choice vs pro life:	"No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant! When rape occurs why is it the poor, defenceless baby who gets no choice and dies? The baby is innocent, yes it wasnt the mothers fault but why is she more important than a child?
Women have become selfish where there bodies are concerned. They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about"	1	[0.5021777749061584, 0.49782219529151917]

1670	Why aren't we held responsible for our reaction time when operating a motor vehicle?:	"It's not the reaction times -- it's the crime itself you're punished for.

Driving while intoxicated is a special case because there are special laws regulating alcholol and other intoxicant. But while it's easy to test for drug/alcohol use in an objective blood test, it's almost impossible to test for emotional or situational impairments.

So, driving while intoxicated can be punished by itself, separately, because there can be objective standards. But anything else can only be punished based on the objective results."	0	[0.5075557827949524, 0.4924442172050476]

1488	Should i sue the driver who hit me?:	Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer do to the poor decisions of others.  If you do plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income.  You are entitled to that amount.  Make sure you have receipts for everything.  It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.	1	[0.5143749713897705, 0.4856249988079071]

282	Cmv   penalty shoot outs do not allow the better team to win, only the luckier team. they should not be used in knockout round matches in soccer.:	"It's a lottery - luck of the draw.

It will decide a winner, to be sure.

But the better team doesn't always win. 

And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.

The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.

Why not?

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.

It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.

100	How to get a expired judgement off my credit report?:	"Why on Earth do people answer these questions when they have no idea what they're talking about?  Sandytoes, asking a court clerk will do no good.  They are not permitted to give legal advice.

That having been said, why don't you give us some more details about the judgement.  What was it for?  When was it perfected?  Why do you say that it is expired.  What state do you live in?

In California, for instance, judgements expire after 10 years.  If the judgment has expired, it is probably not affecting your credit whatsoever.  

The only way to actually get it off your credit report is to petition the court to have it expunged.  Chances are real slim on that.  Otherwise, you're probably just going to have to deal with it being there."	1	[0.5091294050216675, 0.4908705949783325]
111	"Cmv: i believe that the ""my body, my choice"" argument is a double standard, and that men should have the legal right to opt out of any and all child support.:"	"Women in many developed countries have the legal right to abortion in the case of an unplanned pregnancy. However, men often have *less* than no rights in cases involving potential parenthood. Men not only lack the right to choose whether or not they want the child to exist, but also whether or not they will support the child financially. 

If a woman has the ability to choose whether or not she wants to become a biological mother, it isn't justifiable to take away that decision from the biological father. 

**EDIT**: Some people have misinterpreted my post entirely. **I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE A SAY ON WHETHER A WOMAN SHOLD HAV AN ABORTION OR NOT**. I simply believe that, following a woman's decision to become a parent, **a man should the have legal right to abstain from parenthood (the exact same option extended to said woman).**"	1	[0.5062544941902161, 0.49374544620513916]

1817	Why does george bush think it is up to him to decide if 2 homosexuals can get married?:	"Because Jr. doesn’t realize (despite having been told and having pledged twice) that his job is to protect, and defend the constitution of the United States.  He thinks his job is to do a variety of other things.  If you watch him speak for long enough, he will tell you what he thinks his job is, usually something along the lines of “to lead” or “to tell people what I am thinking” or “to unite Americans behind my common cause” or some other rubbish – never to protect and defend the constitution.

So to answer your question, Jr. thinks it is his job to decide if homosexuals can get married, because he truly honestly has no idea what his job really is."	1	[0.5097076892852783, 0.49029234051704407]
1711	Should animal testing be allowed?   stance: should be allowed because...:	Animal testing should be allowed (under strict conditions) until there is a viable alternative that is as cheap and effective as animal testing. Those strict conditions should include: a suitable habitat for the animal, a decent diet, no cruel treatment, and only for certain, specified diseases or malaises. They should not use animal testing for products such as make-up or perfume, but if they are testing a drug that may be a cure for cancer, animal testing is possibly the best route to take, as it is cheap and yet one of the most effective tests available.	0	[0.5161947011947632, 0.48380526900291443]
599	Cmv: i think football in the island of ireland should be called soccer.:	"In the island of Ireland there is football; where you kick the ball with your feet and is seen all over the world e.g. FIFA World Cup but there is also Gaelic football. 

In America there is soccer and football [NFL]. I believe football in America is called football despite being egg shaped is because it is the associated sport of that name in that country, while soccer is the foreign sport.

Based of the above; in Ireland the NFL is Gaelic Football as it is played all across the island; Ireland and Northern Ireland [two separate counties]. Soccer is the foreign sport, so why is different?

Could it be because of the relationship between the UK and Ireland or maybe their political standings? Either way, depending on what side you are on and who you might be speaking to, football can mean two different things. Football should be the national football of a country, soccer should be the foreign sport. Change my view"	0	[0.5023882985115051, 0.4976117014884949]

752	Cmv: since the storm cloaks are clearly the bad guys of the civil war in skyrim and since there clearly exists a good group vs bad group in the conflict it makes the civil war quest line and story weaker cmv.:	Basically I am asserting since the storm-cloaks are painted as the complete villain out of the two choices their( the storm-cloaks and the empires war) is a weaker section of the skyrim story. Let's break down why the storm-cloaks are bad. They are racist they abuse and mistreat those different from them this makes them evil by today's morales and paints them( the storm-cloaks) as the villains and Ulfric as the mastermind. Secondly Ulfric used thu'um to kill the high king, basically he invoked an ancient and powerful gift to kill another bad guy deed. This is what makes the storm-cloaks the obvious bad guys they have nothing that paints them as good in any way except for not being the one to want to cut your head of at the beginning. Try to CMV by proving to me the storm-cloaks aren't just Saturday morning cartoon villains. 	1	[0.5119783282279968, 0.48802173137664795]

No one greeted us, so me and my friends (group of 5) decided to find a seat on our own. Once I sat down the cook told us they could not serve us because they had no plates. Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates.

921	Which is the greater form of music?: jazz or classical   stance: jazz:	"This is easy, classical music is stagnant, most classical music fans are snobbish, they want to hear exactly how it was performed several centuries ago. They put down so-called ""neo-classical""
Jazz is always evolving, it is a living art form. It is always adapting the latest music trends-yet remains jazz. Jazz can take Tin Pan Alley music, pop, RnB, soul, hip hop, world music, folklore et al and it is still jazz. Oh yeah sire they are purists but they are a very small group. Jazz is about improvisation, musicians do not play the same song the same way two times, it is different and fresh every time it is played
Jazz is a melting pot, it was born in the US of A-New Orleans, made up of elements from Africa, Europe and home grown, jazz is freedom, if you can blow, you're in regardless of your background or ethnicity. jazz is the USA's greatest cultural export

It’s more crime comic then a superhero tale, where Batman fights dirty cops and the mob with few gadgets (and no Robin). Mazzuchelli’s realistic art matches the mood perfectly. Batman looks like an athlete in a rental costume, not a bodybuilder in body paint. Miller writes Bruce Wayne as less revenge driven and more noble in motivation.

However, a petition itself is not an actual ""legal document""...it is merely a document stating that X number of citizens happen to take a stand on a particular issue and urge a legislator, official, etc. to act in their favor. For example, you can make a petition in favor of banning smoking, but just because you get a bunch of people to sign it, that doesn't mean that smoking will be banned. The petition itself has no legal standing. Now, if a legislator gets enough petitions all saying the same thing, he/she might WANT to do it if it is in his/her best political interest to do so.

1800	Should all victimless crimes be legalized in the us?:	"I don't think there are any victimless crimes, by definition. We might ask why particular laws are enacted, because they seemingly don't hurt an individual, group, or society as a whole. But you have to look at the full effect of the action to determine if there is harm to society.

For example, prostitution should probably be legalized and regulated, as in many European countries. However, some aspects, such as working a street corner, cause harm to a neighborhood, and should remain illegal. Requiring them to work only in licensed brothels would be appropriate.

I know that must people that were born south of the USA, may speak the same way because after all Spanish is their native tongue, so when they move to speak English they may have sort of similar accent. Let me tell you something, not all ""Latinos"" are the same, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans are very different to the rest of Latinamerica.  You don't say to an Irish he is British or to a Canadian he is American or to a Basque he is Spanish. Culture shouldn't be an excuse to do something wrong, when you are allowed into another country you should learn their customs and traditions. To say that because of my culture i do this or that, is just a lame excuse to avoid responsibility."	1	[0.512535572052002, 0.4874644875526428]

Ordered the holy smokes with frees and a can of pepsi. Can't remember the exact price but it was nearly $20!! Burger was indeed very good and the portion of fries was pretty hefty so that was a plus, they were also pretty good.

The only thing I'm having trouble with is how they justify the price for what is essentially a takeaway burger place. I've had burgers in restaurants that were cheaper!

I'd give it 4 stars if based just on the food but have to give it 3 because of the price. Probably wouldn't get it again because of that."	0	[0.5193257331848145, 0.48067429661750793]

Schumacher, Morris Berman, Philip Slater, and others, who were talking about the problems and limits to capitalism and consumer society. I recently learned that the inventor of fracking, George Mitchell, held a series of conferences in Houston, Tex focused on the ""Limits to Growth"" study. I was shocked that such a rich and powerful person would be fundamentally critical of the very system that gave him so much wealth. I can't imagine oil executives having similar opinions now.

Today, I don't hear our leaders in business, media, or heads of corporations discussing any fundamental problems with our system of capitalism. At best, I hear people talking about solving inequality and climate change through innovations in technology and a sound understanding of economics. All of these solutions are well within the framework of globalized capitalism.

""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....."" Surah 9:5
or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)
And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.
Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.

281	Cmv: sex should be treated as just an activity that people do, like fishing or watching a movie.:	"Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:

1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 

2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 
3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. 

I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!"	0	[0.5036510825157166, 0.4963489770889282]

It's not the *best* beer, mind you. It's *good*, but it's not like, king of beers or anything.

Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.

Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.

Seeing as how you said that there was a Court involved, they would certainly ask the Bailiff to take the person into custody in order that justice may be served.  It would be a time-consuming process of course as are any arrests but I guarantee if you are under oath and admit to a crime (especially murder) then the Court would be obligated to hold that person and begin processing the paperwork.

Anybody who would testify in Court to doing a crime who didn't really commit the crime would then be charged with perjury which is punishable by whatever the State laws allow.

1193	What is your view on affirmative action?:	As contradictory as this statement may sound, I feel that affirmative action promotes reverse discrimination but is very necessary in some cases. The biggest problem we are facing today is that the playing field (i.e. in the business world, college admissions, etc.) is not as leveled as some people may think.  Sure, Black Americans (as well as other minorities) have come a long way from the old Jim Crow days, but there is a great amount of discrimination that still exists.  Believe me, I wish that the policies didn't exist, but then again, that would only occur/work in a perfect, non-discriminatory world...	0	[0.5105858445167542, 0.4894140958786011]

By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.

259	Why did california ban 50 bmg rifles when these rifles have never been used in violent crime in ca?:	That is the most ridiculous gun law passed to date. Your part right on it never being used in a violent crime. I'm not sure where it happened but so far only one person in the united states has been killed by a 50 caliber weapon and i believe it was a 50AE Desert Eagle. The cost of the $3000+ rifles and the expensive ammo that isn't stocked in every gun store makes it very unpractical for any criminal. When california passed the law Barrett actually ended the warrenties on the LAPD M99's, and then came out with the CA legal .416 rifle. Then all the black powder shooters started to complain so CA made an exception for .50cal blackpowder rifles!(which are easier to get by criminals)	1	[0.5119858384132385, 0.4880141615867615]

99	Is everyone entitled to their own opinion?:	"This is an interesting question in light of the laws that punish some people more severely than others because of their opinion, even when committing exactly the same act. I am referring to ""Hate Crime"" laws that enhance a criminal offense because of the person's opinion/rationale for committing the crime. So, if one person kills another person because he hates that person’s ethnicity or religious views then he will receive a harsher punishment than another guy who kills without hate, simply because he enjoys killing. The point is, you may be entitled to your own opinion, but you will be punished for your thoughts and NOT just the act."	0	[0.5168942809104919, 0.48310571908950806]

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer. I'll give goal difference its due, because it measures the strength of the team over the entire tournament, but goals scored is almost randomly decided, and certainly privileges certain styles of play. It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).

EDIT: Let me make myself more clear. The first tiebreaker in group play is goal differential/goal difference. That is right and proper. Then comes goals scored, *then* the head-to-head results between teams. I think the order of the latter two should be reversed."	0	[0.5100034475326538, 0.4899965524673462]

1866	Loz ocarina of time vs. loz majora's mask   stance: ocarina of time is a better game:	Ocarina of time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people regard as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore and one of the most engrossing stories ever to be found in a video game. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. Brilliantly designed and executed, and still regarded by many as the best game in the series. All honors need to go to Ocarina of Time.	0	[0.5215336084365845, 0.4784664809703827]

1850	Cmv: i believe current euro skepticism will lead to the dissolution of the eu and eventually more turmoil in the region.:	"Hi everyone,

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia. Hearing that some member states (UK mainly) are really watching the elections sort of had me thinking if Europe could ever be a unified body. 

Dissolving of the EU would probably be terrible for the region because of increasingly nationalistic parties making a comeback into the political scene. That nationalism, I believe, will create animosity between countries, which, in a worst case scenario, lead to another war.

I really hope I am not being too doom and gloom with this post, but I would really like to hear more about this subject. Please pardon my ignorance if this comes off as so, but I would really like to learn a bit more about what might happen and maybe CMV.

Thanks!

Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.  I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age.  Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience??
The food was great.  The bok choy was outstanding.  Just about all of the dishes show on the menu with a little chili pepper symbols.  However, we did not find them to be all that spicy. 
The 3 stars is for the service.  5 stars would be for the food.

I can see why people here have the opposite opinion and so I'm willing to change my mind. I'm hoping to hear something new though, and not just an argument saying how bad some examples are.

1505	How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?:	"Wow, that's tough.  Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society."	0	[0.5080979466438293, 0.49190205335617065]

On the other hand, its immoral for a man to take another's life no matter what the situation since you are assuming a position of superiority when you do so and every man on the earth is equal. Despite its effectiveness, there are multiple other alternatives to it and capital punishment should not be a first choice.

Its simply a matter of perspective in the end.The typical christian perspective goes against capital punishment and thats due to this christian country. 
The simple truth is that its effective but at the same time, from a biased perspective, its barbaric, immoral, and there are better, though not as effective, solutions."	1	[0.5128170847892761, 0.4871828556060791]

Why don't terrorists blow up every city here? I mean are frisked everytime you leave your house? No. Politics is the governing body that has developed public safety. It is supposed to be built by the people it governs. Arguments happen so people can learn to understand one another and learn. It is okay to debate. You don't have to always be right but take time to learn. 
Its not politics that destroys people, its the media projecting it. Whether you are democrat or republican, you must admit the media slanders whomever is in office.

However, freedom of speech goes hand in hand with the idea of personal responsibility and accountability. Producing those cartoons was technically legal, but it was irresponsible. Surely the cartoonist knew that those cartoons would cause trouble in extremist countries.

However, I also think that the Islamic world is greatly overreacting.

1220	Cmv: cheap foreign labor is brought in by gov't/business to depress the wages of the countries workforce:	If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages. CMV	0	[0.5158238410949707, 0.4841761291027069]

Example: Im Canadian (so will obviously use hockey), Montreal Canadiens are the only Canadian team left in the Stanley cup race. Almost everybody I know has started cheering for them simply because they are the Canadian team left in the race.

You know unionism only grows when the employees sense that management is not dealing with them fairly and respecing the work they do.  When people do not feel valued or respected or acknowledged for their contributions then they become angry and push back in the only way they know how as a group.

Also, he does get bail for an attempted murder charge. People also get bail in murder charges, so I'm not really sure where you are going with that.

If an officer gets in a shooting on-duty, he/she was probably faced with a direct threat to his/her life or a victim's life. Even if justified, the shooting will be investigated to make sure all laws and policies were followed.

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.

Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.

I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar).  I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three."	0	[0.5085223913192749, 0.4914776086807251]

To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.

If someone is in injured or killed in a situation where they could have defended themselves if they had a gun, but were unable to do so because the government deprived them of the means to defend themselves, then I think the government shares some part of the blame for allowing that situation to happen."	0	[0.5171313285827637, 0.48286867141723633]

I think this would allow for games to be much more higher scoring, therefore making it more exciting and more pleasing for the fans. Hardly any games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport.

Think about it... get ready... this is the theory... all matter sucks. Literally!
This theory states that all matter sucks space-time and all other matter just seems to attract, like the ""ultimate sagging mattress"" that is often alluded to.
Besides this being fairly ridiculous, there are a number of things specifically wrong with it.
1. Mathematically, it is fundamentally flawed by assumptions.
2. Various thought experiments create paradoxes.
3. It can never work with quantum physics.
4. Black holes; not even light can escape. So if the velocity of light is the universal constant, why can something change its velocity through a vacuum?

No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine.

- Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means.

The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.

This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate.

I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only 5 minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also not

In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency.
Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books.

1323	Human growth and development should parents use spanking as an option to discipline:	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	0	[0.5135179758071899, 0.48648202419281006]
1692	Cmv: the feminist movement is detrimental to men with low self esteem and recent trend of #yesallwomen only further hampers it.:	"Men such as I, don't have half the balls to make a pass at a woman, let alone the balls to ask a woman on a date. All the things SJWs and /r/twoxchrmosomes talk about is something that most men don't do. It's massively a stereotype. Anecdotal evidence is not a clear indicator of ""oppression"" that's blown out of proportion. In many cases, men don't even get half a chance. For example, Women claim equal rights, but don't even pursue a man because social norms claim they are to be pursued.

I understand that is was a reaction to the perception that social liberalism failed after the 60s ended. However, I feel as though there is overwhelming evidence that neoliberalist ideals create multinational monopolies that exploit the resources of developing nations, creates serious economic inequality, erodes social good, and continues to perpetuate an unstable boom-bust cycle in which only the wealthy have influence. I'm genuinely curious if there are any real benefits to this kind policy? or does it simply concentrate wealth?	1	[0.5136347413063049, 0.4863652288913727]

617	Should parents be allowed to reprimand their children via spanking/smacking?   stance: yes.:	Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.	1	[0.5203711986541748, 0.4796288013458252]

I imagine the settlement involves having all medical bills paid, and that the $20k settlement is for your pain and suffering.  Generally the lawyer will take his fee (either 1/3 of 1/4) of the settlement as his fee, depending upon the terms of your engagement with him.  So it's most likely that all medical bills will be paid, and you will get $20,000, part of which will go to the attorney to pay his fee."	0	[0.5142344236373901, 0.48576557636260986]

If casual drinking is integrated into a society, it can seriously curb binge drinking when one reaches 18, 19 or 21.

* High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists

* When a majority of representatives are freshmen, they will be more idealistic and less jaded, and this will help them serve the public good

It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.	1	[0.513661801815033, 0.48633822798728943]

However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same.

I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it.

The only potential downside is the cost of litigation if lots of people start suing the towns and counties to recover what they think they might have potentially lost, based on what some zoning code did in another part of town.

593	Cmv: the moustache, facial hair in general, has become the embodiment of evil and the harbinger of bad times.:	There hasn't been a president with a moustache since William Taft in 1913 and, since then, people with moustaches haven't been seen as trustworthy thanks to people like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Vladimir Linin, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and many more. When the fingerstache meme first became popular I was mortified because the moustache is now a symbol of barbarism and brutality towards man. To me, anybody that throws up a fingerstache might as well be throwing up a Nazi salute, it's a confession of their secret desire to turn back to barbarism and project their hipster (or should I say Hitler) tastes and preferences onto the populous by way of force. Worse still is the fact that Americas rampant consumerism has created an insatiable hollowness inside the heart of the hipster that can only be filled with fingerstache pillows, quality coffee, and eventually fascism. Each moustache that sprouts from the faces of my beloved citizens is, in fact, a black, hairy, evil flag.	1	[0.5120195150375366, 0.48798051476478577]

136	Should you bribe or not bribe your children to do what you want them to do?   stance: i disagree with bribing my children to get them to do what i want.:	"First off, bribing a child would be defined as doing something like this (Now David, if you just put your shoes and coat on mommy will buy you a toy after we are don at the doctor's office) or (Karen, if you take the garbage out I'll buy that blouse you wanted) or (It's time to get off the swing, we have to leave...come on honey, if you get off we'll stop at the store and buy the video you wanted) or (just eat your vegetable and I'll give you extra icecream) this type of thing being said after pleeding with your child to do what you want.
My point of view..bribing a child is wrong, you have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it...if taught to obey you (thier parent/thier authoirity figure) this should be easy..soemtimes they may not like it...but they are still going to do it ....simply because you told them to."	1	[0.5096474289894104, 0.490352600812912]

(eg. Iraq out of Kuwait etc.)

So in conclusion, the proper answer to your good question would be that the world isn't fair and just because some people have GUNS and ""protection"", (like some states have BIG GUNS and ""protection""), the law is lenient with them.

710	Do you need a fence around a 3.5 ft swimming pool in ohio?:	I believe that you have to put a fence around any pool in Ohio.  Lets put it this way- if you dont put a fence around your pool, and a little child sneaks in and drowns- you would be completely liable, and would likely lose your house, your car, and have your wages garnished for years while you worked to pay off the liability lawsuit.  To me, the risk isnt worth the reward, I would install it no matter what the law is (but yes, I think every pool in Ohio requires one).  Also, if you dont have a fence around it, you might have problems with your homeowners insurance over the liability issue as well.	0	[0.5160273909568787, 0.4839726686477661]

Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.	0	[0.5191856026649475, 0.48081445693969727]

Because a school is a business, the school (business) provides you (the client) with the service of teaching and in exchange you (the client) pay money to cover the costs of providing that service because you (the client) are the one who will benefit from that education.

Sue.  On the complaint, spell out the facts of your case and then ask for alternative relief.  Meaning -- ask for the car to be put in your name.  Then put down that if the court denies you the car, that you are asking for all payments made on the car to be returned to you.  Assuming the facts as you have presented them are true, then the court will almost certainly grant you one fo these two remedies, possibly with interest."	1	[0.5110635757446289, 0.4889363646507263]

Any society that values the value of a human life and promotes non-violent solutions would be hypocritical to include capital punishment in their justice system.

1366	Cmv: i think youtube's possible takeover of twitch is a good thing.:	"Youtube is a big video website that hosts many videos. Twitch is a streaming website where you mostly watch someone playing a game.

If Youtube were to take over Twitch, they would help a lot with the servers and so Twitch would run faster. This is just my speculation though.

Also, Youtubers could get help with streaming and this would help promote their channel.

Youtube could also be then catering to a wider audience, thus making Youtube bigger.

In the past, I've been against some of the things that's happened to Youtube, such as the Google+ integration. But I can't really see many downsides to them taking over Twitch.

Just to note, I do understand that Google own Youtube.

I'm an avid Youtube user, watching several videos throughout the day, and uploading my own content. So if there are any downsides, I want to know about them and put things in place to try and stop them happening to me."	0	[0.5058336853981018, 0.4941662847995758]

A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	0	[0.5223159193992615, 0.47768402099609375]

However, I believe that innovation, or the ability to use this knowledge for an entirely new purpose, is a private effort and should be protected as such. Individuals should be allowed to use their time and talent for economic purposes, in which case intellectual property laws are fundamental. I also believe that abolishing intellectual property could result prejudicial to science and progress as less people would be willing to dedicate their lives to innovating.

It makes sense to feel nothing for the animal as it is another of the many organisms which die and don't effect our lives in any meaningful way.

So while most 'evil' acts are generally detrimental to self and society and should rationally be avoided, and 'good' acts are often beneficial to self and society and should be encouraged, they're both still ultimately amoral.

There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:
1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.
2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.

If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death?

The moral hazard created by bailouts is that business leaders get to keep the profits while the costs of a crash are borne by the public. That encourages them to take big risks at our expense. Adding the personal risk of death should correct this problem.

This would also help balance out inequity in the application of the law. Right now the sword of justice comes down on the poor more than the rich.

I don't like the death penalty in general because I don't think it works as a deterrent; people who commit foolish crimes aren't foresightful enough to be thinking about the consequences. But corporate leaders probably ARE.

Well either way, yes and no. Obviously there are many criminals out there that do not care about the country's ethics and they abuse it over and over over. Those criminals should never be allowed to vote. On the other hand, there are those that are truly reformed and deserve a chance to be an upstanding citizen again. For example, if someone has a record for protesting the war and starting chaos for a good cause, then he/she is hardly a menace to society. Over time that person can mature and learn to channel his/her views in a positive. That doesn't mean they should not be allowed to vote. On the hand, a criminal who has raped, killed, committed hate crimes against different races, etc. should NOT be able to--especially if they are repeat offenders.	1	[0.5166216492652893, 0.4833783507347107]

So, this is really a catch 22 where both sides can win big but, the lawyers assume lots of risk in civil matters--which in some cases they make NO money, if they lose your dispute. So, before lawyers touch many civil cases they will pose some really important questions, i.e, is this a winnable case and is this worth my time--considering how much I (lawyer) could potentially earn?

I don't think it should do so in a way that blatantly discriminates against a group like homosexuals, but it is most certainly within the government's prerogative to define marriage.

Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

329	Evolution vs creation:	"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the ""particles"" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory."	1	[0.5125663876533508, 0.48743361234664917]

A BETTER IDEA: contact your local news agency.  Expose him on national TV!  They love to expose people like this.  It's good for their ratings and it would cause him to stop (hopefully) or at least lose his business licence, etc.

It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.	0	[0.5218369960784912, 0.4781630039215088]

I am okay with a private property owner calling a tow company to remove a vehicle from their grounds, but only if the police are involved just as they would be if they were having a trespasser removed. In that case the towing company should only be allowed to move the vehicle to the closest available public roadway or grounds. If at that point the police deem the vehicle should be impounded, then and only then should the vehicle be remanded to a *police* impound lot.

Being that there 600,000 men, I think we can safely assume there were over a million people gathered. Now, even back then in ancient Israel, getting millions of people to believe that all of their ancestors were at mount Sinai and God spoke to them is an insane task. It would be EXTREMELY difficult to fake something like that and get a whole nation to believe it. Therefore, I believe that the national revelation proof makes Judaism the most believable religion.

If this is court awared inheritance, then the court will most likely require a financial advisor.

Aside from the investing, what the person whants to do with the money is up to them. There really isn't any other steps to worry about.

You don't need to tell the government, you don't need to include it on your taxes unless you want to, and frankly, other than investing, there isn't much more for you to do, aside from get the check, cash it, invest it, and live.

Don't go overboard, and spend all the money at one time, mind you.  Spend well, and leverage your money the best you can."	0	[0.5119239091873169, 0.4880760908126831]

* Nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all.

* Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. 

* Everybody should be able to buy govt approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking.

* Everyone knows the war on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you dont think people should be able to do drugs but you cant say your solution is prohibition but I know I guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth.

This can be hard to prove, especially if there has never being a court order in place as far as visitation.  My opinion, the judge would order specific days for visitation first.  If he did not follow the visitation dates, the judge will assume that is basically giving up his parental rights and could order you sole custody.  Again, this may take some time.

As for child support, definitely.  He will be subject to back child support from the day she was born unless he can prove that he was paying.

You would do both of these by going to your county child support services office and filing child support payment/custody documents.  Not hard to fill out and they will assist you in doing them.

I cant find any reason to justify this behavior as a moral human being. The bait fish suffered badly when caught, suffered more when we jammed a hook through their face, and suffered even more as they were stalked by larger fish and the suffering then ended when they were eaten. 

At which point the other fish suffered with a hook through ITS face, faught for their lives as I dragged them to the surface, then removed the hook and started over.

However when you look at the spirit of the law, I believe it is still lacking, mostly due to geographic and monetary limitations. The disproportion in schools in wealthy, mostly suburban neighborhoods, to the poor mostly urban neighborhoods, is a problem we have yet to deal with.

140	Do dogs have the capacity to remember   stance: dogs have the capacity for remembering people, places and objects:	"The popular assertion is that IF dogs have the capacity to remember, it is a short term capacity. If a dog has learned not to go to the bathroom in the house through the use of paper training or kenneling, this is often termed conditioning.
Perhaps in the example above, we are dealing with conditioning, not memory.
How do you explain this: A dog is brought up with a child who leaves the home to go to college. The child returns home after being away for six months. The dog's reaction to this person entering the home is frenzied, lasts for quite a bit of time and is marked by whining and a significant sow of affection. These behaviors are not observed when a family member returns after being away for an hour or two. In fact the dog shows little if any enthusiasm in this instance. The dog is equally indifferent when introduced to a stranger."	1	[0.5192658305168152, 0.48073408007621765]
1690	Cmv: nationalism causes hate and bigotry:	"I am Canadian by birth but my parents are from Serbia and Croatia. I find everyone in Canada tries to hold onto their culture and wave a flag signifying their bloodline and heritage. I thought this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a time but discovered I don’t need to define myself by a single (or two or three) nationality/nationalities.

From what I have seen, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. 

Why can’t we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity? The fear of losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted. CMV

I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences.

This is not to say that news isn't valuable.  But it does mean that if you read the paper every day and gravitate toward the Ukraine stories while having virtually no historical background, having never been to the Ukraine or Russia, never done any research or met people from the cultures involved, you should speak, think and feel with in an extremely humble tone about the subject.  In fact it would be more wise to ask questions than to profess any opinion at all.

Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.

It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but is totally legal to have sex with someone free. It is not legal to have sex with someone for money, but it is totally legal to have film two other people having for money if you sell that film commercially. A rational, logical human being would never be able to understand this, which is why it is something only lawyers and politicians could come up with.

""Deportation breaks up families""

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. 

"" Texas was Mexico's""

This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.

Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries.

Pilate himself was sorrowful and didn't sentence Jesus, rather washing his hands of the matter.
Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.
And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.

Any good law will have safeguards, and rational provisions so that whatever action is made illegal is really the action that is the threat. I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.

That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.

1352	The death penalty should be abolished in singapore. do you agree?:	"Disagree.  Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice."	0	[0.5088676810264587, 0.4911324083805084]
276	Cmv: i don't believe climate change is happening.:	"To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. 

I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. 

Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling. "	1	[0.5068717002868652, 0.49312829971313477]

Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for(car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting.  Then there are even some that call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe laws.

If you were the dad:
You could always just give extra money that doesn't go throught the courthouse. 

Otherwise, you can request a review, which takes awhile to complete, but child support offices go to the employer and verify all of the income, and then reevaluates the amount per month owed.

Some states give cost of living increases every year, but some don't.  

Don't listen to the jerks telling you that you should be able to support the child on your own.  You didn't get pregnant on your own, and you sure shouldn't have to support that child on your own.  

Circumstances change throughout life, that's why this evaluation is in place.   Consider if you were both very young when you got pregnant and he was in college or working for minimum wage, but now he's got a decent job.

After extensively following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling like it's very likely that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony.

So many of the most credible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, so many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar(claimed to work at Area 51).

I would love for it to be true that aliens have been visiting earth and its all a big coverup but I can't think of a single credible example that hasn't been thoroughly discredited. CMV."	0	[0.510131299495697, 0.489868700504303]
1074	Cmv: i think that outsourcing to china isn't all that bad:	The workers in China, even if they get paid only pennies, clearly need the money. My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed. 	1	[0.5145060420036316, 0.48549404740333557]
1531	Cmv: politicians should not be allowed to campaign through cold calls:	"I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion:
I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.  I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated).  Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).

I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.

To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.	1	[0.5116550922393799, 0.48834487795829773]

There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.

The full legal text says, ""You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.""

Determining what is ""primarily intended"" for commercial purposes is somewhat hazy, but if you are not making more money than it costs to run the site, etc. (factoring in non-cash costs like your time as well), you are likely acting within the license.

If the charges were dismissed or you were found not guilty, then the County cannot seek reimbursement.  If you were found guilty and sentenced to County jail, then you must pay.  If you reached a plea agreement and were sentenced to ""time served"", then the County can seek reimbursement.

There is a very good chance something may erupt between the U.S. and Iran. They and many other Arab/Muslim nations hate the West and are supporting terrorist organizations. So if a devastating attack occurs within the next few years Iran is the number one target. Also people have to realize that Israels interests are Americas interests; they are one in the same. So even if we do not have a war/conflict with Iran directly there is a good chance Israel may; which would involve us in the situation.

2162	Cmv: had it not been for the holocaust hitler would be germany's napoleon.:	Let's say that he continues with the plan to move the Jews to Madagascar or does nothing at all to them. He conquered a lot more land than Napoleon or Rome and in a shorter amount of time. He brought great empires like Russia, France and UK almost or to their knees. Something that the Germans of the previous generation wished they could do during WWI. He made Germany rise from the ashes like a phoenix and get revenge for Versailles. He also planned the Autobahn which is a modern architectural masterpiece. I believe that if it weren't for the horrors of genocide Germans would be a lot more proud of their history.	0	[0.5152556896209717, 0.4847443103790283]

But unless you're pretty certain they'll be OK with it, you should ask someone if you can put a link to their website on your blog. That would  be the right thing to do from an ethical standpoint as well.

A lot of people create 'banners' for other people to put on their websites as a link to their's. But some people don't mind if you put the URL.

Bottom line is, when in doubt check it out. I can't answer your question about the legal ramifications (see link, below). But my bet is that you could end up getting into some hot water with someone if they haven't given you permission prior to your adding the link. Why risk it?

I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent.

94	Should religion be involved in our human rights?:	"In one sense you bring up an interesting point.  Let me challenge you with a broader concept...

...do our Laws reflect our Morality....or does Morality stem from the Laws we make each other abide by?

In their written series of civilization, Will and Ariel Durant made the point in the first book, ""Our Oriental Heritage"", that man did not need or make laws until he thought his neighbor needed them.

Think on that a bit as you ponder your own question.

In my own personal opinion, I do believe that faith can and should inform public policy.  In a republic such as ours, we have agreed to abide by the majority, until a new majority comes into being.  And each new majority will bring its' own set of values."	1	[0.501903235912323, 0.4980967342853546]

The only 100% safe birth control is not to do it. So if he went ahead with the act and she accidently got pregnant, he is just as responsible as she is.

On the other hand, if she intentionally got pregnant, and knew he had no desire to have a child, then he may have a case. But that will probably be hard to prove. I also agree that the child should not be punished or suffer because of this, but neither should the father.

I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.
My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them.
My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die."	0	[0.5160556435585022, 0.4839443266391754]

With a proper nurture, a person can grow and mature well. 
So, with the help of those psychologists and or psychiatrists the bad behaviors of those persons can be cured and remedied."	0	[0.5181702971458435, 0.4818297326564789]

If Cricket is to survive as a sport, then we need to get rid of games that last 3 days and don't always have a winner. et rid of the boring whites and boring defensive play. Only the old guard and a tiny fraction of Cricket fans like this form of Cricket.
People would rather pay £40 to go see 20 overs of cricket full of 6's and 4's and lots of wickets, rather than sit there a full day and see one wicket and only singles.
If it is to expand and appeal to people then we need excitement and money. Money only comes from entertainment.

Yes, primarily it's for moral reasons.  There are arguments made about health risks, but a regulated industry with check-ups and the like would be arguably safer than the drug and disease ridden industry as it now stands.

Basically, I think it comes down to the fact that few people want to put society's ""stamp of approval"" on it.  Would anyone want their daughter to consider it ""just a job"" or an easy way to get some quick cash?  Or would they want their husbands to be able to find no-hassle sex whenever they had some extra cash?  How about the thought of your father casually going to a brothel after work?

He can't do that without an informed opinion on the facts involved.

What more are you expecting him to tell you?  He will either agree to represent you or decline based upon the others opinion weighed against his risk factors.  And even if he declines to represent you, it doesn't necessarily mean that your case isn't worth pursuing in general.  It just means that it isn't worth it to him.

I personally see it as a foul thing, for people often regret it when they are older, it can cause irreperable mental and physical damage and is simpy morally wrong.

Reality TV shows influence our children in a negative manner, for example the bachelor, teachers our young teenage girls that we have to be beautiful and fight for a man with 20 different women to get their attention to have a fairy land wedding, that is not reality. Also, many of the reality shows, such as rock of love, flavor flav, demean women in a sense and this is what our children grow up watching.	1	[0.5158205032348633, 0.4841795563697815]

875	Is correct grammar more important that the welfare of other?:	It matters to those of us who attended schools where all this was important, have or had parents to whom it was important and have jobs where it is important. If you can get through life without any of those applying to you, then you may well conclude that it is all somewhat irrelevant and who can blame you?  I think that by anybody's standards it is better to be a good and caring person than one with impeccable spelling and grammar. And having seen your original question, I think that you are worth twenty of those people who are so arrogant and superior about their command of language and who seek to put you in your place.

They do the children more damage than good by ripping them from famlilies with no explanation, keeping them apart from their families and basically terrorizing everyone. Babies included. I have seen many families destroyed. My son's is one of them. And there seems to be no way to deal with them beyond letting them play thier God games and bowing low each time.

2133	If the government has the authority to kill people, they why do they say that they are against violence?:	The principle here is not that they are able to kill people but for what reason. The execution of a known felon who has him/herself murdered countless lives has forfeited his/her right to live under the eyes of the law. If he/she were to be set free and thus cause more deaths on the population it is justified to take his life for the general good. They are against violence, random and senseless violence that is. Sanctioned killings whereby a person has commited crimes deemed irreconcievable in the eyes of the community is not a crime nor hyprocracy but justified and necessary. As for war it depends on the reason, to the defence of life and country it is a noble cause, for an outster of a regime not friendly to a country that is selfcentered hyprocracy for a nation that cherishes life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	1	[0.510909378528595, 0.48909059166908264]

It's not entrapment for law enforcement to send minor decoys into a liquor store to see if the clerk will sell them alcohol.  It would only be entrapment if the minor decoy used extraordinary means to convince the clerk to sell alcohol to him.  The test is, was the clerk predisposed to commit the crime of selling alcohol to minors.  If the decoy just says to the clerk, ""Oh, come on!"" and the clerk gives in, the clerk was already predisposed to commit the crime and it's not entrapment."	0	[0.5138888955116272, 0.4861111640930176]

2183	Evolution vs. creationism   which is true?   stance: evolution:	"Evolution has been backed by science including DNA tracing as well as by archaeological findings such as Lucy.
Evolution just states that species can evolve in order to adapt to their environment.
Humans have evolved most likely from apes in that their DNA's are very similar and they have some of the same behavioral patterns as us. These would be things like using tools to find their food.
While evolution is a scientific theory, it is not what the average use of the term means. Most people say theory about things that haven't been proven yet and there is much doubt. This is NOT the case. A scientific theory can only become fact when there is absolutely everything discovered about it.
Gravity is only a scientific theory as well as the theory of relativity. Seeing how gravity is largely believed to be true even as it is a theory it seems ridiculous to condemn evolution as needing proof.
Therefore, we can say that evolution is more credible a theory than creationism."	0	[0.507621169090271, 0.4923788011074066]

If a judge has a standing policy against such things in his courtroom, whether on or off, you could be held in contempt.

Breaking a law is dangerous when you are prone to get caught.. however, people tend to bend laws and break laws.. to which the penalty is not severe.. say, like speeding, not wearing seat belts, etc. Any law would be right if it doesnt invade the realms of Human rights and religious beliefs of a person.

444	Cmv on high fructose corn syrup:	"I am highly against HFCS because, in short, it kills people. While I understand it is cheaper, it is by no means better. Examples.

1.) Any type of artificial sugar can cause obesity, or even cancer.
2.)  Factories that produce HFCS are very unregulated by the FDA. Tests have proven that there are contaminates of mercury in some batches of HFCS
3.) HFCS and cane sugar are NOT biochemically identical, and our bodies do not process them the same way
4.) The corn industry is VERY corrupt and has been causing local farmers to go out of business, having a detrimental effect on the US economy

I believe that HFCS should not be used by major companies such as coca cola and Pepsi. It has a terrible impact on the quality of the product, and destroys our health, and our economy"	0	[0.5077317357063293, 0.4922682046890259]
395	Why is it ok for the media to invade people's privacy, but not ok the government or private citizens do?:	"Ethically, it's not okay for anyone to invade the privacy of an innocent person.  It's stupid and potentially dangerous to stalk celebrities, and many suits have been brought against various photographers and publications.  However, we have the right to know what the government is doing-- because it's with our money.  Governments steal from us, then use the fruits of their theft against us.
Anyone arguing that the 4th Amendment protects our privacy from the government is living under a rock.  The 4th has been effectively nullified by SSNs, gun records, increasing search & seizure to look for a ""probable cause"", phone tapping, and the fact that the government is so vast and powerful that businesses are being forced to collude with bureaucrats and hand over what little privacy we had left."	1	[0.5080459117889404, 0.49195414781570435]

1645	Do you think britain should compensate the nations it colonised?:	Strangely enough in New Zealand the crown has been made to pay compensation for breach of treaty with the intengenous people. Despite  the treaty not being recognised at international law. There have been a number of other treaties established during the colonising period, which if New Zelanad is precedent should burden the common wealth. Personally I am in the view that these indiginous peoples did not have the state sovereignty and capacity to enter into international relations that has been a corner stone in international law. I think that if Britain was to compensate pruely for war losses, then arguably America would owe Vietnam for breach of state sovereignty, Germany would owe Russia for breach of non agression pact (contract), and Greece would owe Iran for breach of Kings peace. I think there would be a indeterminate burden of liability and any orders to make effect such a action would be unjust on the world as it exists today	0	[0.509900689125061, 0.4900992810726166]

Some lawyers speak in a very demanding voice in an attempt to undermine your confidence and to dispute the truth of your statements. Beware!

For me, just because a human cannot survive on it's own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious ""sanctity of life"" issue. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it.

2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors.

Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient.

728	What are the shorcomings of any public opinion poll?:	"The primary shortcoming in any public opinion poll is that there is a tendency toward bias at every stage of the questioning process.  The person asking the questions has his bias; a person who wrote the question has her bias; a person who is answering the question has a bias as well.  The former two forms of bias should ideally not show up in the results of an ethically conducted poll, however they often do.
The next most important shortcoming is that while ideally the sample set (the specific group of people to whom the poll is given) is big enough and diverse enough to represent the general population, commonly small and/or homogeneous samples are used to save money or time or both.  Sometimes homogeneous and small samples are used by unethical poll takers to influence the outcome of their poll.
In short, polls will never be 100% helpful until they are designed, executed, and administered with practically no human intervention whatsoever.  But what's the fun in that?"	0	[0.5091791749000549, 0.49082082509994507]

For example I came to do a final year project that was self proposed so I really enjoyed it and didn't want it to finish but it seemed that everyone else just wanted it out of their hands showing no passion for what they created. So now I have come to the conclusion that universities are not here to serve humanity and everyone's love for sciences or whatever subject they do but instead its just a production line for the corporate world.

However due to designer breeding, these short nose type of dogs have terrible problems breathing and a host of other health problems are generally expected. Every bubble of air is a struggle, which is probably a factor of why they sleep so much and probably is a cause for several of those health problems. I suppose there is optional surgery to increase airflow, but the vast majority of owners don't opt to do it. It breaks my heart to see these amazing dogs gasping for air, I can imagine all the health problems I'd have if I had to struggle with every breath. If I am misinformed please help, I'd love to own a beautiful bully but I'd feel terrible for all these reasons. 	0	[0.5146462321281433, 0.4853537678718567]

While again, the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have stemmed from this culture that are themselves bad for society.  For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing).  Another is the inherent disrespect that comes with the culture, and just overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos of vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch.

I feel like that I am missing or not appreciating something about these sports, and that if I was made aware of some uncovered aspects then I would enjoy them a lot more.  Are these sports really that exciting?  Or is it more that they have been ingrained in the American culture so much so that the attractiveness and appeal of the actual game is an after thought?

895	Why cannot a company advertise their product as better than another competitor's product as better than theirs:	"What does that mean?

Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.

By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.

Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying ""Product A is better than product B"" and ""Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them""."	0	[0.5102792978286743, 0.48972073197364807]

If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think.

If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. 

Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job.

In fact, many scientists believe caffeine and maybe even sugar are more dangerous than marijuana.

This societal ""norm"" is the only reason that marijuana is illegal, and not allowed for many employees even in states where it is legal (Colorado and Washington). Alcohol and tobacco have hugely negative effects on our society as a whole, but going out to get a drink, or just having some beers while watching the game, are some of the most common things done either to meet people or with people you're already friends with.

119	Cmv: the race car is a better vehicle than the dirt bike for 90% of maps on hill climb racing.:	Forgive any rambling, Im going to ensure I hit the 500 word limit. With the exception of the moon where the dirt bike is amazing to rack up coins with flips and crazy air time, the race car is the superior vehicle. On maps like the beach and the cave the down force keeps you down on the big hills and keeps you in the ground. On Highway and Rollercoaster, forget about it, it's tailor made for those levels. I have made all of my high scores with the race car, on every map except the moon. Another huge downside of the bike is it's so flippy, if you get onto a hill and you lose momentum you end up doing a back flip and you slip backwards and can't get back up without a run up. With the race car, once you get forward momentum the downforce keeps your front end down and you will get up any hill. CMV!	0	[0.5195701122283936, 0.48042988777160645]

You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.	0	[0.5196329355239868, 0.4803670644760132]

The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.	1	[0.5204238295555115, 0.47957608103752136]

866	How come someone can have an abortion but once the baby is born it's considered murder to kill it?:	"Most countries where abortion is legal, as far as I know, accept it only during the first three months of pregnancy, where the foetus isn't even properly termed a 'foetus' but rather an 'embryo' (I think). If you've ever seen pictures, it doesn't look anything like a human yet and it has no brain function and thus can feel no pain and has no awareness of its existence (for anybody wanting to ask 'how can you be sure?', all I can say is that I'm not - this is only what I've read). Well before birth, a foetus has become very much a human being (though not one that can survive independently) and then it is a crime to remove it.

Please remember that very few people who have had abortions see the question as black-and-white as many anti-choice people do. Every one of them wrestles with their own morals and conscience in their own way."	0	[0.5072051882743835, 0.49279478192329407]

__________________________________________________________

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. 

Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university. "	0	[0.5164838433265686, 0.4835161864757538]

They assume that information found in books or news channels or newspaper are more truthful. I disagree. I'm a true neutralist who believes that just because a propagandist had the money to spend to distribute their information through a book or a newspaper article, it doesn't give it any more credibility than typical things we see online. We should obviously look at everything with an open mind and try to figure out what is truth and what isn't, I just don't believe in that idea.

1539	Cmv: there is no obligation refer to nobility by their titles/honorifics.:	"It is often appropriate to refer to individuals by honorifics such as ""Doctor,"" ""your honor,"" or ""Captain."" In certain situations it is considered disrespectful to not refer to a person by their honorifics\titles.

However, it is my position that nobility NEVER deserves to be referred to by their honorifics/titles (King, Queen, majesty, Prince, ect.). Why?

(1) Nobility is completely unearned. Nobility is something passed down through family lines. A doctor earns their title, a duke does not.
(2) The system of nobility is historically oppressive. Individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society. 

These two reasons remove all obligation to refer to nobility by their honorifics in any social context."	1	[0.5079358816146851, 0.49206405878067017]

A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do not see the aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For most people a shop robbery is wrong. But taxation is justified on the basis of a ""social contract"" or other vague concept.

We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say “drafted” when we could say “slave soldier” or “drug confiscation” when we could say “theft of herbs”. These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.

Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance.

1. If your engine stalls or you have some other kind of problem as you are are crossing the tracks, you no longer have momentum to carry you to safety.

2. The act of stopping could cause another vehicle to crash into you because they are not expecting it.

3. If for some reason you stop but don't actually hear/see a train coming for any reason (unlikely, but still a possibility), you are now on the tracks for a much longer period of time, increasing your risk.

I think that the safest option just approach level crossings like every other vehicle on the road.

It would disintegrate before it even arrived at the sun.. Perhaps we would be able to do it once or twice a year where we could be certain it would land. But maybe we should just fire it into the vast openness of space. Scale wise, it is highly unlikely it would ever hit anything within several hundred years. We just need to shoot it with enough power to reach Earths escape velocity, and in some sturdy container that wouldnt burn up as it left our atmosphere. 	0	[0.5098922848701477, 0.49010777473449707]

- Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some.

Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion."	0	[0.5094715356826782, 0.4905284345149994]

Sure, I would entertain the idea of institutionalizing the mother until the birth if she is using illegal drugs....after that, she should go to prison.  The problem is, who is going to pay for that?  That's right, the taxpayer.  Again, the taxpayer has to take responsibility for the stupid things people do.

Accountability is the number one lacking quality amoung many Americans today.  The fact that we as a society tolerate stupidity and irresponsibilty, is enabling these morons to continue making poor desisions, having children, doing drugs...etc.

Until we hold people accountable and responsible for their actions, there is no real solution.

2 the government has to spend tax money to build new prison's, because so many people get arrested for possession.
3 Government could tax it similar to how they tax tobacco and alcohol, so they could potentially make Millions maybe even more.

 For example, my country sends to jail everyone who fails a suicide attempt, which I think is ridiculous for obvious reasons.
And if the person isn't able to do it on his/her own, asking someone to do it, either by ending her life through ""direct"" methods such as a painless poisoning or by ""indirect"" methods such as turning off the machine that keep that person's heart beating.

I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them.

This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within Britian there would be nothing keeping christianity from running a parallel law system. Its the classic situation that many parents face; you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britian, which is both illegal and totally unneccesary. If a muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country that has it as their primary law system.	1	[0.5138384699821472, 0.4861615002155304]

I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. 

Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why:

She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. 

There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. 

The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. 


Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women. 

Any woman that exhibits this kind of behavior today would be considered to be an asshole and coerced into going into therapy and/or rehab. Courtney Love, anyone?

But generally, if a person, without a doubt, has been convicted of a malicious crime, they should be put to death.

1597	Which type of endeavor is better a personal pursuit or advancing the common good:	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time.

I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	0	[0.5197421312332153, 0.48025786876678467]

business name: caffe boa. city: tempe. categories: restaurants, italian, american (new), breakfast & brunch:"	"After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. 

We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.

Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)"	0	[0.5117592811584473, 0.48824071884155273]

I feel ultimately iy paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supports/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything. 

Whilst there are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, i do think that a lot of people will feel this particular campaign has a lot of merit so that it keeps it in the social conscience.

Expungement of the records is another matter and that requires more legal work.  Even if that were to be granted, there is always a paper trail and just, for example, the fact that someone was arrested in the first place will always be part of that trail.

1038	Why is marijuana illegal?!?:	"It's not legal because it can't be regulated by the government, because it's generally regarded as a gateway drug (one that leads to other, more dangerous drug use), and because, since it hasn't always been legal like in some European countries, legalizing it would not only lead to a massive initial interest in it-- which would lead to increased health care costs (don't front; it damages respiratory systems and impairs judgment) and decrease labor quality-- and all those drug dealers who sold weed would need to find something else to do, and my guess is it wouldn't be a legit job-- so it'd also cause a spike in crime; probably gun sale, or increased trafficking in worse narcotics.

Today in most states employeers have to report new employees to the state because of child support laws.  This will be a way for them to catch you.  The other main way is with your taxes.

I can't even enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to film the show. They've ruined every social situation I can think of.

Something else I've noticed is that a lot of people have started to become more accepting of more and more people.

I believe that until these issues are better delt with, people will not be able to believe that our justice system is efficient enough to ""correct"" anyone.

If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him.

I am now in a long-distance relationship where there is a pressure to move to where my significant other is living and working. 

We are both in inflexible corporate jobs. I believe although I am pass 30 years old and I do love him, I cannot sacrifice my career anymore for a big move. I dont speak the language he speaks (although I am learning it, I speak it in an elementary level).

CMV. What beliefs do you hold that can make me move to be with someone I love but which will make me throw away everything in my home country. What else should I be thinking about for those who have had to make these choices as well?"	0	[0.508353590965271, 0.4916464388370514]
2068	Which type of endeavor is better a personal pursuit or advancing the common good:	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	0	[0.5145944952964783, 0.48540550470352173]
1528	Cmv: looks played a role, even in getting counter culture bands into the spotlight..like grunge bands:	"Now bear with me. I know that the frontmen of 90s grunge bands were not specifically sold as sex symbols. And I know they were reacting against things like hair metal and glam rock (not STP) which were consciously selling men as sex objects.But lets take a look at the frontmen:

Kurt Cobain: Good looking, blonde blue eyed, looks like hansons uncle

Eddie Vedder: def above average pretty man

Scott Weiland: in his pre anorexia days a very handsome man

Chris Cornell: Not so sure ...think he is good looking? Ladies?

Layne Staley:  I think he is probably the least but still not ugly.

They were all very talented no doubt, but is it an accident that the bands that made it big had pretty or handsome frontmen? I mean even outside of grunge, have you seen younger pictures of Michael Stipe?"	1	[0.5028625130653381, 0.4971374571323395]

Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.	1	[0.517253577709198, 0.482746422290802]

747	Cmv: if you can't be pro israel if you're against annexation of crimea without being hypocritical:	"In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people.

In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing, one secured their military base, the other ~~wanted their holy land back~~ also secured their military presence.

Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths.

Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing."	0	[0.5019208788871765, 0.4980791211128235]
459	Should college athletes get paid?   stance: no, they shouldn't get paid:	College athletes do get paid. Going to college costs money, if they are good enough and maintain a gpa they receive scholarships which are essentially debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 an using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is automatically no.	1	[0.5226100087165833, 0.47738999128341675]
1184	Can a person who gives a gift (birthday)to a recepient have the right to take it back once gifted?:	"Regarding the property, if it's in your home, no one can take it without a court order or a criminal complaint alleging it was stolen. Since it is unlikely the gp will falsify a police complaint, I wouldn't worry too much about the property.

Generally speaking, the police do not have the right to enter your home or property without a warrant in the majority of cases, Exceptions for responding to call from home and domestic violence.

In the matter of the child, you really need to consult with a local attorney. There are too many variables for anyone to give you specific or accurate advice over the Internet.

Good luck and hang in there."	0	[0.5126100778579712, 0.4873899519443512]
1215	Cmv: i believe that religion prevents moral growth/change.:	"I know this is not true for all religions, there are many, but I'm mainly referring to Christianity and Islam(as they are the ones I know most about).
 I believe that morals should be like trading cards, you can swap them out whenever a better one comes along. I feel that religion keeps people stuck to the views set down in that religious text. I think that without religion people would be much more willing to accept new views as they come along. E.g. Catholicism and contraception or homosexuality. People basing their moral views on thousand year old texts seems obscured to me. I am aware that there is room for interpretation but I think the world would be a better place if people made there own moral decisions instead of being prescribe them by their religion.    
 I am not against religion I just think your religion should not control your morality CMV. Thanks.

769	Is mccain copping out or is he actually being sincer?   stance: he's copping out because he knows he'll look bad in a debate against obama:	"Let's assume that Senator McCain is sincere and actually wants his input in the bailout of the economic crisis in case he should become the big cheese after the November election. Okay, but keep in mind that he has admitted that the economy is not his strong suit, I let him slide on that too.
What stops him from giving up just a few hours for one evening to be part of a debate that is very important to his election chances?
Because of that I feel McCain is running scared which is hurting his chances, he's demonstrating that when it come to crunch time, he'll bail and look for something ele to do"	1	[0.5037733912467957, 0.49622663855552673]
1685	Cmv   the lion king is hugely overrated:	"There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was lion king.

Even if you hadn't seen or heard of Kimba the White Lion, the Lion King was so predictable as to be cliche. The characters and songs weren't anything more special than any other Disney movie either. 

I believe that the people who prosthelytize about the movie are mostly the ones who watched is as kids or young adults looking through nostalgia colored glasses. People who's first exposure to a real and dramatic story was Lion King so they came to believe that Lion King did something unique or special (when it really, really didn't)."	1	[0.5119746327400208, 0.48802539706230164]

And Batman has no powers- just gadgets- Magneto could make short work of him.
And the flash? So he runs. Wow. Oh yeah, professor X could take him down too. In fact- professor X could probably take them all out by himself without all the other god like marvel characters."	1	[0.5103176236152649, 0.4896823763847351]

If teens and younger people who so-called ""don't deserve it"" are being subject to this as well, then they do deserve it, for the reason that they choose to act like these criminals, and they need to be taught a lesson.
