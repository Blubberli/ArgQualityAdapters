I think the sovereignty of these states isn't as clear as it used to be, and the lines may blur further as the EU ages. They're all tied together in so many ways already, including EU laws, EU high courts, and EU monetary policy. The key detail about the EU states is that the citizens are *equal*.

cehk1iy	"The question of resources will be the more powerful factor, at least in the short run. Whether we are simply in a global warming cycle or not, whether the changes are directly caused by humans or not, the global average temperature increase is undeniable. Although many technologically advanced populations will be able to adapt to those changes, less-developed groups are already living on the brink and simply don't have the resources/tech to overcome those changes. Pressure on resources like food and water might be more focused in the less-developed countries (although we are seeing droughts in historically ""safe"" regions), and those conflicts have a way of escalating, boiling over into larger conflicts. In short, regardless of the causation question, we are seeing historically high temperatures and severe storms; unless the trend reverses immediately, it will cause major pressure on food and water resources, leading to immediate loss of life in less-developed countries, political and military conflicts in many areas, and potentially incite major conflicts."	3.7777777777777777	2.0942156314849854

When that happens, I can be asked for a source (and then can hopefully provide it), or I can be ignored (since my fact is ""probably false"").

Also, regulation of porn would be virtually impossible. The government already regulates it (can't sell to children under 18) but the internet makes a mockery of that. So unless the US government starts limiting the internet to the extent that North Korea does, you won't be able to limit porn.

Of course there is *personal* respect; i.e. when you respect a person for who they are, what they stand for, etc. Then there's respect for a *position*: You can respect the *office* of the President, the *position* of CEO, or a higher military member's rank without respecting them personally. With age comes mistakes, with mistakes comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom. We are all more or less biologically the same creatures, with the same urges and the same fallibility. Older people have generally already made the mistakes that younger people make, and have lived through the consequences of those bad decisions. Some choose to impart this wisdom upon the younger people by telling them what to do and what not to do. Again they make the mistake of explaining the rule, but not explaining the *reasons behind the rule*. As a result, the youngling disregards the lesson, seeing no purpose to following it -- But more often than not, the elder was right. Therefore many elders earn respect of *position*.

I could see an argument, perhaps, in photography necessitating less creative input than other art forms, or being less expressive, but even that is up to debate.

There is a much higher rate of divorce among love-based marriages vs arranged marriages. And, while true love has a happiness which can compensate for all those things, doesn't having the stability of an arranged marriage offer happiness too? While you may not like your husband at first, you will get to know him very well and may actually build up a love that will last rather than share a flaming passion that gets extinguished when you actually start living with a person and find them to be much different from the person you fell in love with.

cbhmm6h	Drug markets are static- they will exist regardless of any restrictions or disincentives that are put in place. This fact can't be denied, especially in the case of addictive drugs like methamphetamine. Once someone is hooked they have a biological imperative to seek the drug that overrides any moral or ethical reasons not to. Addiction is a medical issue, not a moral one. The fact that violent cartels have come to be top dogs in the drug market is not the fault of the consumers, it's the fault of the restrictions themselves. Non-criminal enterprises are barred from engaging in the drug trade, meaning that criminal organizations are the only ones who are able to take advantage of the market. Additionally, people are solely responsible for their own actions. If a ruthless murderer decides to make money off of drugs, that doesn't mean it's his customer's fault he is a murderer. 	4.3	2.036275625228882

ci7sgmb	I'm not advocating eliminating the right to self-defense, so I'm really not on the hook for that entire second paragraph. My argument is that insisting that everybody do everything for themselves (self-defense, self-diagnosis, etc.) eventually makes everybody completely ineffectual. And OP has not showed how the argument does not apply to all these other self-activities. (Edit: if you replace bullies with cancer or giardia, you see how ridiculous the argument becomes. Yes, if you can diagnose and treat yourself that'd be neat, but not everybody _can_, no matter how many times you hit them with cancer or giardia. Sometimes, you need external help.) Essentially, the argument was that everybody can eventually learn to do these things for themselves and will be better off for it. So why does it apply to bullying and not all these other things? That's why the argument is not compelling.	2.625	2.0116491317749023

You will need to consult your student agreement with your college to determine if you signed anything acknowledging this, which would make changing your view largely irrelevant. Secondly, unless you are taking a unique course for which there are no other available professors or sections, why did you not sit in on someone else's class on the same subject?

He is not corrupt, he does good by the people, he respects civil liberties, and the country prospers. What happens after his death? Does his son take power? What if his son's an entitled dick who doesn't care about anything but his own happiness? Is there a fight for power? That will eventually leading to the best fighter becoming leader, which has been shown to not be great for civil liberties. Not to mention the frequent bouts of civil warfare results in death and destruction. So we have elections.

cfdjriw	I think this was asked earlier but I'll have a stab at it. I think the problem with men and women sharing locker rooms is that the differences are glaring. With homosexuality you might not even know there's a gay guy in your locker room. It only becomes uncomfortable when you become aware. There's a certain degree of arrogance when it comes to certain straight men about homosexuals that just because he's gay he must be interested, not only in their penis, but in everyone's penis. The truth being that gay and straight men have shared the same spaces of being undressed for centuries. And in these places in particular these people are professionals. There's 100% likelihood that any gay person within that locker room is thinking about the game more than they give a shit about someone's cock.	3.571428571428572	2.012183427810669

cmgl19r	In your defence, nearly every working definition of knowledge in modern epistemology lists truth as a necessary condition for knowledge. The trouble with this condition is that we can claim no certainty in whether our belief has verified this condition. Meaning that if knowledge is possible, there is no belief that you can be justified in claiming is knowledge, even if it is knowledge. So not only are you committed to a less rigorous definition of knowledge, but you're also committed to a less rigorous definition of what constitutes a met condition.	3.5	1.9852577447891235

Instead of calling seatbelt laws ""gay"" (since they have no gender and no sexuality), you can call them ""overbearing"", ""overprotective"", ""big-brotherish"", or another word or phrase that means this.

Therefore we can assume that it holds a monopoly on the job industry in this town. At which point, they can pretty much establish whatever pay and working conditions they want, and the workers wouldn't be able to do anything about it because there's no other employment options in this town.

cd9eji2	Sorry but that doesn't prove anything. Can you provide a conclusive proof that shows supply and demand always works correctly with human labor? While you agree that a lot of economics is up for debate, you seem to have missed that economics represents a pure math being tied (with varying degrees of success) to the real world. Considering some economists are very optimistic about rent ceilings, I cannot see how it's very objective that price ceiling on labor has that much of an effect. For one, the supply of people willing and capable of working those ceiling jobs far exceeds the demand (like it or not, there's quite a few middle managers with the expertise to run a big company, that simply won't get the chance). Who is getting the deadweight loss? People who are not willing to work for $1m/yr because it's not enough money. Where does that affect an economic cost? (except, perhaps, of businesses moving elsewhere solely for the top employee's benefit package...I doubt it'll be that common an event) And shortening the workweek would be a side-effect more than a goal of that.	3.0	2.2127721309661865

Also, I'm not sure about this, but I think it might be possible that the reason black people get longer sentences and more conviction rates is that we're so used to seeing black America as ghettos, poor, etc. in the media that we assume that all black people must be this way. So affirmative action in this case would just be covering up the real issues: That we need to work on improving these neglected communities.	3.333333333333333	2.042206048965454
