clkx5lv	Terrorism and Islamophobia are the same thing. Both result from a lack of understanding or hatred for a group with a different religion or ethnicity. Both result in violence. The only difference is the particular ethnic group or religion that the person hates. In saying this, there has definitely been a greater number of deaths and suffering caused by Islamic terrorists than caused by Islamophobes.	3.125	1.740278959274292
cbktun5	Yes it is unfair. But is it fair to ask a man to pay child support for a child he did not want ? I think you are collating 2 'unfair' things that aren't really dependant on each other. As /u/FishNetwork stated, ideally the government should pay for child support. This isn't always feasible so getting both parents to pay for it is the 2nd best solution. What's important here is the child getting support, not men vs women.	4.6	1.9395712614059448

c9qt52r	"I'm not sure I would agree, because there are a number of conventions and tropes that occur across a large number of anime shows, in a way that doesn't really compare to ""foreign films"". What stock characters could one ascribe to ""foreign films"" that would compare to the ones that recur in a number of anime, for example? I might grant that anime on the whole is a broader categorization than specific genres like horror or romantic comedy, but I think it occupies a weird area between genre and medium--I still think ""anime is on the same level as TV or movies"" is an inaccurate way to describe it, because TV and movies do not have as many common strands and threads uniting them as anime does."	4.285714285714286	2.435011625289917

The problem with ""eye for an eye"" is that it doesn't always serve justice.

cg61mop	J.R.R. Tolkien didn't contribute anything to his genre. His work is pretty detailed with a lot of backstory but he took a lot of his themes from already-established mythology and simply used a cookie-cutter theme of good triumphing over evil. Many failry tales from the Miedieval ages used such a theme, where the hero is reluctant to leave and is eventually coaxed into going, eventually returning triumphant with a whole lot of stuff in the middle. Using Propp's fairy tale outline, you can plug at least TWO events in the LOTR into each of the 33 categories. The argument that males contribute a lot more is, in my opinion null, because no one has actually contributed much in terms of themes of genres for hundreds on hundreds of years. 	3.6666666666666665	2.147451877593994
c9yt4sp	You cannot simply kill people the second they are found guilty. There are so many flaws in the legal system that people are wrongly sent to death row and during these 10+ years they are found innocent. Since 1993 there have been 18 men that were found guilty and sentenced to death, only to be found innocent during their time on death row [source](http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/The_Innocent_and_the_Death_Penalty.php). So if we were to kill people the second they were found guilty, then all of these men would have died for something they didn't do. And what you are suggesting is against due process and is illegal. We would have to re-write the Constitution.	4.571428571428571	2.0128731727600098
cd0yx3v	This sort of positive encouragement is fine in combination with other good parenting strategies. It can be overdone, but as long as you reward them when they try hard and when they succeed, and also balance out the encouragement with advice on the reality of the world, it'll be fine. In fact, I think you need to add the motivational stuff if you're also going to instruct them about the harsh realities of the world. They need to understand that it's not **just** tough and unfair. They also need to learn that despite it being tough and unfair, they can still achieve great things through hard work and persistence, but to keep their morale throughout the tough times, it's important that they believe in themselves. I think the real issue is a lack of balance.	4.666666666666667	1.945584774017334

ccmbsu4	Pedophilia *is* morally wrong. Just because someone is rational and intelligent does not mean that they are morally right. A *different* question is whether we should punish urges as well as actions. The action should and is punishable by law. The urges should *not* be punishable by law, but they should be treated and controlled. Pedophilia is looked down upon because it is morally wrong to exploit people who are not mature enough to give informed consent to sex. Using a power/age/maturity differential to satisfy your urges at the expense of impressionable and immature people is morally wrong. Many things were commonplace in the past that are no longer commonplace, such as slavery. Just because something has taken place commonly in the past does not mean that it is right.	4.666666666666667	2.1644644737243652

How about men who've been abused who can't handle it, and are now lesser men because they're not keeping it together like a 'real man should'? What about homeless men? What about black and other minority men? Have they never been thought of as lesser humans? What about sexually abused men who are expected to have enjoyed what happened to them, due to societal standards regarding men and sex? What about depressed and suicidal men?

If a woman becomes pregnant while using birth control and can't prove that she was using it at the time, she could be charged with rape, for something she almost certainly didn't want to happen herself.

cf3wzr5	You're conflating hip-hop/rap and black people. Just because most rappers are black doesn't mean that disliking hip-hop means disliking black people. You might as well (but probably wouldn't) say that country music = white people, so disliking country music means disliking white people. You wouldn't accuse someone who dislikes spicy food as hating Mexicans/Indians, would you? So why conflate a dislike of a music genre dominated by black people with a dislike of the people themselves? Me, I fucking love Motown/soul, but I can't stand hip-hop. I can't relate to what they're rapping about (usually bling, pigs, bitches and popping caps in asses), and the only thing musical about it is a sample they stole from someone with musical ability. It's just some dude ruining a great tune by talking/shouting utter bollocks over it. That doesn't make me racist (if I were, I'd hate soul, too), it just means I don't like hip-hop. 	3.2222222222222223	2.1089699268341064

So by that criteria, it is you who isn't a true feminist. If you call yourself a feminist, perhaps you should stand up to those who make your group look like sexists? Mary Koss comes to mind and has greatly influenced feminist academia. Her feminist ideology is why we have '1 in 4' inflated statistics, and she explicitly states in her book (look it up if you don't believe me) that the rape of men is a nonissue and doesn't deserve attention. Many feminists continue to take cues from her, and that is why the CDC was pressured into separating male 'rape' into a distinctly 'non-rape' category.	3.4285714285714284	2.1678223609924316

A few years later it was ""Well, maybe global warming is a legitimate thing, but it's not caused by human behavior! That's just a left wing hoax to stop us from buying big cars."" In another few years, maybe republicans will cave to the overwhelming evidence, but there will always be another excuse for inaction -- ""Look, China pollutes way more than us, how is it our responsibility to cut back emissions, how is that fair??"" People are changing, slowly, so I'm cautiously optimistic. But it's the comments I see online saying ""environmentalists get way too worked up about stuff"" that I get a little touchy about.

cca04ci	Are you simply arguing against sex among adolescents and people who don't fully grasp how to handle an adult relationship or against sex before marriage in general? Because to me it sounds more like you're arguing against the former. Sex among adolescents makes things way more complicated in a time when people are just learning how to be in relationships at all. I lost my virginity myself at 19 and I think it was probably too early then but I still don't regret it one bit because it was with someone I trusted at the time. Since then I've had relationships that were simply sexual and ones that were overall fulfilling and whether or not we had sex really didn't have much effect on the relationship at all. Currently I'm 26 and still unwed and sex has not complicated things for me in a very long time.	3.333333333333333	2.1609625816345215
cbn1pwa	Your mental model of the physical world is not necessarily correct - we know for sure the determinism fails in certain situations. We have personal experience of our own consciousness that suggests there is more to understand about the universe - we can't explain consciousness without something more than current physics. So the basis of your reasoning (a deterministic world) is incorrect - the world is not known to be a turing computer and we have (non-scientific) hints that it might not be. Libet etc.. changes little - we know the brain is physically the centre of cognition, and that people are not independent from it - it is no surprise that multiple areas contribute to the outcome of an effect. The experience of consciousness is certainly layered - so to have free will doesn't necessarily mean that decisions have to be taken at the highest layer.	3.0	1.939717411994934

Prostitution can have truly terrible outcomes. Johns sometimes rape, abuse, and murder hookers. It's incredibly dangerous and risky. Legalizing prostitution counters the logic of the routine activity theory. Although motivation of offenders is difficult to manipulate, by increasing security and decreasing availability of suitable targets, it's hypothesized that crime rates can be lowered. Legalizing prostitution would completely eliminate security, since police will no longer be concerned with it, and raise the availability of suitable targets dramatically. Many claim prostitution is a victimless crime, but legalizing it would quickly prove it is anything but that.	3.0	1.9801690578460693

The official poverty line in the UK is 60% of the median household income, which at present is about £120/week for a single adult with no children. The international poverty line is $1.25/day, which comes to about £290/year. So someone just at the poverty line in Britain makes about as much in 3 weeks as someone on the international poverty line does in a year. Basically, the poorest people in the UK are generally much better off than the poorest people worldwide, so it's perfectly reasonable that we spend some money on addressing international poverty before we have completely eradicated poverty in this country. It's worth noting that going by the British poverty measure, if everyone suddenly earned 10 times as much as they did today and there was no inflation, the poverty level would stay the same. Poverty is defined here compared to other people in the country, not based on being able to afford basic goods, as you might expect.	4.285714285714286	1.9962480068206787

That doesn't mean that physiological differences between groups of people haven't still arisen inside of those hundreds of thousands of years. Think of the differences that exist between people of different ethnic groups. We can look at race as a societal structure because those biological differences are the result of *social* influences. Decisions were made within the frameworks of economics and politics - social structures - that caused societies throughout history to split off and settle into new territory, causing them to eventually show different physical traits. How can you say for certain that the biological differences between men and women are the product of human evolution, when it's obvious that changes can take place in a shorter period of time than hundreds of thousands of years?

cd4p8t8	Well, networking isn't the most important but it helps a lot. Just knowing the boss won't get you a job you're completely unqualified for. However, networking is beneficial to the employer for at least two major reasons. 1.) It can provide more trust in the potential employee's abilities. Instead of hearing from a random guy that employee A is great and the best, I know personally (or at least from someone else who I trust) that employee B is great. It's much less risky to hire employee B rather than A 2.) It demonstrates a certain level of social abilities. Very few jobs take place in a vacuum; most involve other people and teamwork. Networking demonstrates that the employee can form professional relationships well. Also, some jobs require a certain amount of networking to complete but I assumed you weren't talking about those.	4.428571428571429	2.0017192363739014

cl6m2q1	Institutional racism- if it didn't effect them directly it certainly effected their parents. That means wherever they are economically, its less than where they should be. If they learn from their parents that white people aren't to be trusted then they are going to behave in different ways than if they consider themselves fully integrated into society. This effect isn't going to fade until everyone who was alive to experience it dies and then some. Slavery itself... every black family that is descended from slaves is at a huge disadvantage. They started from less than nothing. No one alive today went through that, obviously, but it has downstream effects on how parents raise their kids, their economic standing, and most importantly how they shape their kids beliefs about society. I am not trying to say that black people today are directly affected by slavery, of course they are not. But it was a huge cultural movement in this country and the effects that I mentioned won't go away overnight, especially since racism was still essentially legal as recently as 50 years ago. 	3.6666666666666665	2.014096260070801

To make this system work, we need to figure out a way of setting things up so that the pamphlet-maker is a) competent to understand and convey the political platforms of the candidates, and b) can be trusted not to 'fail' at the above task on purpose, even if someone makes it worth his while to do so.

cj31xj3	Hope is what you place your faith on once you have done all you are willing to put into something you care about. So it's not necessarily an excuse for inaction, but rather a concept that follows an amount of action that one puts in and is no longer capable physically or mentally to continue putting in further action. Hope is independent of whether someone put in action or not.	3.6666666666666665	1.8676948547363281
cbjjlqf	&>> but I also don't see why persons in a polygamous relationship need the state's recognition of the plural marriage.Asking for the government to endorse and accomodate every religion's particular beliefs is not what freedom of religion is about. I agree, however I get the reason and support government endorsement of any religions definition of marriage because the only reason they started endorsing marriage in my opinion is to help spouses access their loved ones in hospitals and to make decision in the case of being incapacitated beyond cognitive response or to have full access to children created within the marriage. The problem came along when Christians began to think their religion is the only religion and all the others are just heathenish. The tide will change very quickly soon as the more Atheists and other ignored religions point out Christian hypocrisy in politics.	4.0	2.1025798320770264

cfau6kk	You cannot define every action as moral/immoral/amoral. Each action depends on its circumstance and context. Moral absolutism is bullshit. Yes, you can. Even if every action depends on its circumstance and context, you still define them as moral/immoral/amoral. Whether or not you look at actions with context or not, you still make a moral judgment about them. Your argument here doesn't support your conclusion. You say that you can't define every action, but your next sentence says that each action depends on its circumstance and context. But what exactly is being depended on? The chosen course of action? If so, why are you choosing that particular action? Each action you chose, you chose because you believe it is either the moral action, or that it doesn't matter. You can never chose an immoral action, because you can't ever truly believe you are making the wrong decision (otherwise you wouldn't make it). Thus, every action you take you are saying is the correct action for that specific situation, which is absolutist in its own way. 	4.2	2.0821187496185303

I'd like to believe that just like any other group, gay people are diverse and have the same range of personalities... they just happen to be gay. The over-the-top celebration seems to focus on the craziest, most eccentric parts of the group and unnecessarily make it seem like straight people and gay people are so different in everyday life. 	3.4285714285714284	2.0789952278137207
ck86wee	I am aware from your opening post that you believe that intent is a good measure to judge things in trial. You restated that in your post. You didn't really address my argument that trying to work out someone's intent is a rather poor way to actually work out their intent to commit crimes. You said that if you commited a crime, weren't caught, you shouldn't support punishment for others who were caught. I was pointing out that you could emotionally not support yourself being punished but rationally think that you and others should be punished and thereby support punishment of others and not yourself.	3.2857142857142856	1.9786765575408936

In this case, I think it's perfectly normal to have these feelings of insecurity, but you're probably better served by addressing it in a more direct manner, instead of trying to hide behind it and defend it as something it's not."	3.888888888888889	2.2188751697540283

cgu12fq	We infer there is a duty not to steal because doing so is taking something that you are not in rightful ownership of. A person has rightful ownership of the money supposedly because either it was transferred to them by someone else (e.g., like if your uncle gave you his inheritance when he died, even though he didn't have to) or because it is the fruits of their labor (e.g., you worked for it). I'm not sure how one could argue we have the right to ensure the survival of our fellow man. Surely it would be morally praiseworthy to do so, but it doesn't seem we have a duty to do so. In other words, it's very commendable if someone goes out of their way to help someone, but we cannot expect them to do so since it isn't their duty.	3.555555555555556	2.0804197788238525

If you can put yourself in that frame of mind, it's much easier to wrap your head around why some of their more popular songs are as popular as they are. Another problem some people don't seem to realize is the fact that the Beatles had a MASSIVE library of successful songs, and their songs are so universally loved that even if you don't like the Beatles, you've heard a solid two or three albums worth of their music over and over and over in the media. Try listening to songs like She's Leaving Home, or Hey Bulldog, or Two of Us, and you'll see where they were truly innovative and interesting. 	4.0	2.06540846824646
